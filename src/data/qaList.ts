    question: "Why is there so much stock clothing?",
    answer: "In a modern industrial supply chain, any product involves many suppliers. If any supplier encounters problems—such as insufficient funds, production management issues causing non-compliance with buyer requirements, or even weather factors—it can affect the entire chain. Sometimes, buyers may also cancel orders due to market downturns or financial issues, leaving otherwise deliverable orders as stock.",
